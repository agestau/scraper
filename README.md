# Let's scrape some books! :books:

## About

* This script combines two tools: Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape books from two different websites. 
* If desired, results can be saved as a .csv file.


## Instructions

* To scrape either of the sites, you will have to specify the genre and the amount of pages you'd like to scrape.


## The code is easily modifiable, feel free to adapt it to scrape other sites!
